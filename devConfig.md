# DevConfig

> For detailed configuration guides and advanced setup instructions, see [Detailed Configuration Guide](./detailedConfig.md)

## Primary Objective
Build/Refactor the codebase (Nebula-Singularity Team) to a production-ready state in pure TypeScript, eliminating dependencies and incompatibility issues. Achieve zero-defect tolerance, complete feature parity, and superior performance.

## Key Requirements

1. **TypeScript Implementation**
   - Build with all code as pure TypeScript (Convert if possible)
   - Ensure type safety across the codebase
   - Utilize strict TypeScript configuration
   - Implement proper type definitions and interfaces

2. **Code Quality & Performance**
   - Achieve zero known defects
   - Exceed performance benchmarks
   - Simplify configuration for main branch integration
   - Implement code quality gates
   - Use ESLint with TypeScript rules
   - Enforce consistent code formatting with Prettier

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement comprehensive testing suite:
     - Unit testing with Jest
     - Integration testing with TestCafe
     - End-to-end testing with Cypress
     - Performance testing
     - Security testing
     - Usability testing with automated UI tests
   - Maintain 100% code coverage
   - Implement test-driven development (TDD) practices

4. **Development Standards**
   - Ensure code maintainability and scalability
   - Adhere to established coding standards
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use dependency injection where appropriate

5. **Infrastructure & Deployment**
   - Implement robust CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure automated testing and rollback capabilities
   - Set up monitoring and alerting systems
   - Ensure production deployment readiness
   - Implement containerization with Docker
   - Use Kubernetes for orchestration

6. **Documentation & Security**
   - Create comprehensive user documentation
   - Conduct thorough security testing and vulnerability scanning
   - Implement API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Maintain up-to-date architecture diagrams

## Development Scripts

### Build Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "build:prod": "tsc --project tsconfig.prod.json",
    "build:watch": "tsc --watch",
    "clean": "rimraf dist"
  }
}
```

### Test Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:e2e": "cypress run",
    "test:integration": "testcafe chrome tests/"
  }
}
```

### Lint Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix",
    "format": "prettier --write 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'"
  }
}
```

### Development Environment Setup (Nebula-Singularity Team)
1. Install Node.js (v18 or later)
2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install typescript @types/node jest @types/jest
   npm install eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
   npm install prettier
   npm install testcafe cypress
npm install -g @netlify/cli
   ```
3. Configure TypeScript:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "ES2020",
       "module": "CommonJS",
       "strict": true,
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "skipLibCheck": true,
       "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
     }
   }
   ```

## Code Organization (Nebula-Singularity Team)
```
/src
  /components     # React/UI components
  /services       # Business logic and services
  /models         # TypeScript interfaces and types
  /utils          # Utility functions
  /hooks          # Custom React hooks
  /tests          # Test files
  /config         # Configuration files
  /assets         # Static assets
```

## Expected Outcome
Deliver a robust, performant, secure, and maintainable codebase (Nebula-Singularity Team) that is ready for production deployment with:
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Production-ready infrastructure
- Complete documentation

## Important Notes

## Pre-Push Workflow (Nebula-Singularity Team)

Before committing:
1. Run validation suite:
```bash
npm run pre-push
```
2. Address critical errors first:
- Security vulnerabilities (CVSS â‰¥ 7.0)
- Build failures
- Test coverage < 100%
- Performance regressions > 10%
3. Document resolutions in commit message using:
- [Security], [Performance], [Testing] tags
- Impact analysis
- Mitigation strategy Review the output, noting errors, warnings, style violations, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Address critical errors, security vulnerabilities, and performance regressions first. Escalate unresolved issues as needed. Re-run `npm run pre-push` until the output is clean or within acceptable thresholds. Ensure code quality, security, and adherence to project standards. Update documentation to reflect changes. Summarize resolved issues, their impact, and fixes in the commit message.
